# Stuff needed for victoria 3 country

More things may be added in the future but for now this should be good

## Country 

A country is defined as a list of states

* A map of all the states
* Details on specific important landmarks, mountainous areas, or geographical features
* All the rivers, including their importance
* Outbound connections and locations of overland railroads that might be built

### State

* State Name (e.g. Portucale)
* 4 cities
    * 1- The main city of the state (e.g. Portucale)
    * 2- The forestry city of the state (e.g. Portucale's Tree Farm or a completely different name if you want)
    * 3- The port city of the state (e.g. São Bento), if it is a coastal state
    * 4- The mine city of the state
* Each city should have a specific location, please include them in the states map
* A description of what the state produces the most
* Any famous builds the state might have (e.g. Lusitania has São Bento, and the monastery in Provence, the townhall of Pavia, etc)
* Population sizes, what states are more populous and which are less populous

## Cultures

Each culture should have:

### Culture 

* Culture name (e.g. Lusitan)
* Culture color and color name (in rgb value) (e.g. Lusitan Red = 249 00 00)
* What states they should show up in (or just the whole country)
* Cultural Obsessions (ingame items) (e.g. Brews)
* Tabboos (ingame items) (e.g. how muslims irl don't drink alcohol)

## Religions

* Religion name
* Religion icon
* Where the religion is practiced (list out the states and the proportion it is practiced in)

## Characters

* Ruler names
* What interest group(ig) the ruler belongs to
* Commander names and their interest group
* Interest group leader names (existing igs are listed below, more may be added or removed in the future)
    * Buildfriends (try to pass laws that tend to be pacifist and focus on building more cultural buildings and lower cost of building materials)
    * Industrialists (try to to pass laws that make factories more profitable, lower economic taxes)
    * Grinders (try to expand natural resource harvesting buildings and laws, pass botting laws)
    * Pvpers (try to expand military facilities, pass laws that makes it easier to declare wars on others)
    * Roleplayers (this might split into roleplayer and politician)(wildcard ig, depending on the ideology of the leader, a communist roleplayer will attempt to pass communist laws, etc, think of this as discord players)
* Generic name lists for random name generation, both first names and surnames
    * Lusitania might use a portuguese name list, Lambat a filipino one and Gensokyo a japanese one, or you can make up your own names.

## Government layout

Given the previous list of interest groups, how would you say the government of your nation is split. Who's the most powerful? Who's in power and who's opposition?

For example, in Lusitania you'd have:
* Buildfriend king
* 50% Buildfriend ig in power (led by X)
* 20% Industrialist ig in power (led by Y)
* The pvpers would be marginalized with a few % (led by Z)
* The grinders and roleplayers would be in opposition with grinders having most of the leftover %

## Flags

* flag colors (in rgb)
* alternative flags for different styles of government (e.g. communist lambat, democratic lusitania, etc)
* What the flag would look like if it was a subject of another nation (and the ruling nation had a canton on the flag)

## Journal entries

Want to provide objectives or guidance to people playing your nation? Write out journal entries. For example, Pavia could have a journal entry to build the townhall, Lusitania could have a journal entry to connect to the GOR, to be the worlds leading producer of brews... the sky is the limit

## Events

Does your nation have any particular quirks? Do you want to represent an event happening in certain conditions? Any historical remarks that happened you want to see ingame, providing temporary bonuses or buffs? Write about it. For example the marriage in Pavia would be a wonderful event to write about.

## Alternative history countries

All of these would need most of the stuff described in previous paragraphs

* Have a cool supra national idea for a country? Like what if the states of the medi sea united akin to the german federation did, through diplomacy and military conquest? Write about it
* Have a cool alternative history where X person takes control and they steer the nation into a whole different path (e.g. CommradeNick loses the MtA elections and MtS is reformed, or Banyough takes over lambat and makes the Republic of Lambanyough)? Write about it
